# Demonstration of PWM using Timer 3
This example shows how to set up Timer 3 (the General Purpose Timer) to generate Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) on two output pins.
PWM is frequently used to do variable brightness on LEDs or for digital-to-analog conversion when combined with a suitable lowpass filter.

## Use
Connect GPIO pins PA6 and PA7 to LEDs (with appropriate current limiting) and observe that they fade at the same speed, but phase-rotated by 180Â°.
