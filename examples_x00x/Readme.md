# Examples for the CH32V002/4/5/6/7 and CH32M007 chips

Examples which are different from the default CH32V003 examples will be here.  Each example may only work on a subset of the chips as they may depend on features not available in all members.  Examples should target the chip with the lowest feature set which support the given example.  Examples *should* work on all higher members even if the target is a lower member of the family.
